### Monogame Engine Changelog

##### 26/10/2019 - dunkybaldy
* Attempt at getting keyboard events working more efficiently and precise
	* Quick press of 'W' still results in key hold events

##### 13/10/2019 - dunkybaldy
* Sorted out event system with a bit of maintenance and slight improvements
	* Better definitions of events (more specific)
	* New EventCategory class for quick subscriptions (broad terms eg: Keyboard)
	* Event type should be checked in handleevent implementation
	* Added validation for key bindings from settings json file
	* Begin implementing flooring
		* Requires 2d modelling
	* Fix debug issue with symbols not loading in ExampleGame (uncheck 'Optimize Code')

##### 08/10/2019 - dunkybaldy
* Player class successfully consumes event type of keyboard
* Solved problems:
	* On pressing unbound key, threw exception causing thread to fault
	* Fix was null checks

##### 07/10/2019 - dunkybaldy
* Add input manager which uses device manager to poll for input events and send to event manager
* Problems:
	* On pressing unbound key, halts all input acknowledgement

##### 17/09/2019 - dunkybaldy
* Single transformation class holds entity position and rotation and other locational/directional data
* Created a camera and cameramanager
* Camera passed into entity render method, to lock onto an entity, override render in child class and update camera target
* Anything which requires a graphics device manager will need to have it inserted after game class has been instantiated as it will cause a circular reference during the DI stage
